          How to start Coding ?<br />
          Are You thinking to learn coding . <br />
          I will help You how to become a successful web developer and how you
          can grasp any Coding languages. <br />
          <br />
          First you have to give atleast 2 Hours a day for coding It's a Minimum
          Time . Learn Coding from Paid cources or You can learn from Youtube
          Videos It's Free of cost. After you start you may get some issues but
          after few days you will enjoy the courses . <br />
          Then try to Make your own website You get experience,by creating new
          websites <br />
          Then You Have to build your "Own Empire". You can make Money by
          Freelancing after you become a efficient Coder . <br />
          <br />
          Many people say perfection in coding can make money no one is
          Perfect,even I am not perfect. we get little problems in making
          websites or making app whatever you make. We have to make notes while
          learning coding. <br />
          That notes Help us when ever we forget any code, after that we get
          idea to make new things. <br />
          At last I advice you don't do coding for making money. Do it as your
          Hobby or passion.
